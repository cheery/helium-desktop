# Helium

This project isn't anything visually interesting right yet. If you have raspberry pi, you can try this but be aware it requires multiple libraries that aren't resolved by themselves yet.

It might be an interesting project if you want to tinker with GUIs or redesign your desktop from the bottom up. This is my attempt to make it easy, after all.

I'm not done yet!
